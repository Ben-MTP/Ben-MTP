## Hi there! üëè

Glad to see you here.

I am ManhKM, a Java backend developer, and a university student. I love programming and writing technical blogs.

I have experience with Java, Spring Boot, and JPA (OracleDB, MySQL).
Besides, I also know about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little knowledge of frontend development).

Currently, I am digging into the Java ecosystem and trying something new, such as Angular, Docker, etc.
